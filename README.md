# Careers in Library and Information Science <br> Metadata Workshop

## About the Workshop

This 90 minute workshop is part of the Careers in LIS week-long exploration (insert link here) held at Bryn Mawr College in May 2019. It is designed to be an introduction to the field of metadata librarianship. Participants will gain a basic understanding of what metadata is; what a metadata librarian does; and some of the major challenges and considerations surrounding metadata creation and use. One hour will be devoted to a hands-on training in basic cleaning and validating of metadata using [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/).

## Workshop Requirements
### OpenRefine

OpenRefine is a tool that provides a graphical-interface for cleaning, transforming, and enriching imported metadata. OpenRefine and some extra reconciliation services will be pre-installed on campus computers for use during the workshop. If you would like to install the software on your personal laptop, you may follow the instructions [here](/installation). 

### RDF Extension for OpenRefine

[Reconciliation](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Reconciliation) allows you to match your data against external and authoritative data services. OpenRefine has many reconciliation options. We will be using the [Library of Congress Subject Headings](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html) reconciliation service, which is a RDF data source, so we will need to install the RDF Extension for OpenRefine. You may follow the instructions for this [here](/installation).
