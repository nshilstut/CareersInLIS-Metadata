# Careers in Library and Information Science <br> Metadata Workshop

## About the Workshop

This 90 minute workshop is part of the Careers in LIS week-long exploration (insert link here) held at Bryn Mawr College in May 2019. It is designed to be an introduction to the field of metadata librarianship. Participants will gain a basic understanding of what metadata is; what a metadata librarian does; and some of the major challenges and considerations surrounding metadata creation and use. One hour will be devoted to a hands-on training in basic cleaning and validating of metadata using [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/).
