# Validating Data

## Reconciliation

[Reconciliation](http://freeyourmetadata.org/reconciliation/) allows you to match your data against external data services to reconcile known entities. The goal of reconciliation is to connect your collection-specific vocabulary to a controlled vocabulary on the Web.

## Wikidata Reconciliation

Let's try reconciling the **Place** column against [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page. 

1. Click the upside down arrow next to the column name and choose Reconcile > Start reconciling from the dropdown menu. 
2. Choose Wikidata under Services, and select "city of the United States" under "Reconcile each cell to an entity of one of these types." 3. Select "Auto-match candidates with high confidence." 
4. Click Start reconciling. It may take a couple of minutes to complete.

## LCSH Reconciliation

Let's try reconciling the **Ethnic Groups** column against [LCSH](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html).
