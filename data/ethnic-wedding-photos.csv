Wedding coordinators and bride guides are consulted.  With nothing left to chance, planning often takes months. The wedding can be officiated by anyone licensed to marry -- a member of the clergy, an interfaith minister, a civil marriage celebrant.  The bride usually wears the most extravagant white dress she or her father can afford.  Wedding party attire is color coordinated with the floral decorations -- bridesmaids in matching dresses, groomsmen in ties of the same color, even the two mothers often agreeing to something similar.  The marriage may demand a fairy tale wedding, which seeks to be memorable and unusual in a climate of sameness, often incurring considerable wedding debt.  In contrast, the procedure of an upper class Anglo-American wedding, held most often at the bride™s home, recognizes family traditions.  Most of my pictures depict the varied customs kept by this group, the sons and daughters of my WASP or Jewish friends and other couples to whom I have been recommended.--Katrina Thomas","Nieces watch Story and Bill share wedding cake at a reception, held in an ancestral mansion of the bride.

Wedding coordinators and bride guides are consulted.  With nothing left to chance, planning often takes months. The wedding can be officiated by anyone licensed to marry -- a member of the clergy, an interfaith minister, a civil marriage celebrant.  The bride usually wears the most extravagant white dress she or her father can afford.  Wedding party attire is color coordinated with the floral decorations -- bridesmaids in matching dresses, groomsmen in ties of the same color, even the two mothers often agreeing to something similar.  The marriage may demand a fairy tale wedding, which seeks to be memorable and unusual in a climate of sameness, often incurring considerable wedding debt.  In contrast, the procedure of an upper class Anglo-American wedding, held most often at the bride™s home, recognizes family traditions.

It was more relaxed than the two Catholic weddings celebrated within the Bronx community, possibly because these families have moved to suburbia. The bridegroom is the son of an imam. Without him, in a caravan of cars the groom's family drives to the bride™s house to bring her in a limousine to her conjugal home. Upon arrival, Emira sits in the limo while a young nephew is put in her lap for luck in producing sons. The bridegroom Afrim greets her in a restrained manner. Her mother-in-law, standing at the door of the house, holds a small bowl of sugared water into which Emira dips the fingers of her right hand and touches both sides of the doorframe. Then stepping into the house, right foot first, she is introduced to the kitchen, after which her new sisters-in-law celebrate her arrival by dancing, while she stands without moving, apparently oblivious. Later, at the reception, her family is present but they sit at tables apart and do not communicate with her. The sole Islamic touches that I noted were an imam reading brief excerpts from the Koran, and the lack of liquor.--Katrina Thomas","Emira, the bride, in her new home is introduced to the kitchen by the bridegroom's sister.

Muslims make a distinction between marriage and a wedding. The marriage solemnizes a written or an oral agreement, al-mahr, money awarded to the bride by the bridegroom, and usually takes place privately in the home. It is not photographable because the bride and groom remain in separate rooms.  Presumably, the marriage is not consummated until after the wedding, which announces the union of man and wife to the community. It takes place any time from a few hours after the marriage to a few years. A henna evening may be celebrated before either or both. The bridegroom's family pays for all festivities. What is distinctive besides the lack of alcohol, except clandestinely, and the sexes being divided so that women dance on one side of the hall and men dance -- dipping, hopping, stamping their feet -- on the other side, is that the bride and groom do not participate.

"Albanian (Muslim) Wedding, Old Tappan, NJ, 1990",Albanian (Muslim),"Old Tappan, NJ",1990,Marriage customs and rites | Marriage rituals | Dancing,Feast and reception | Dancing | Children," The only Albanian Muslim wedding I photographed was in New Jersey. It was more relaxed than the two Catholic weddings celebrated within the Bronx community, possibly because these families have moved to suburbia. The bridegroom is the son of an imam. Without him, in a caravan of cars the groom's family drives to the bride™s house to bring her in a limousine to her conjugal home. Upon arrival, Emira sits in the limo while a young nephew is put in her lap for luck in producing sons. The bridegroom Afrim greets her in a restrained manner. Her mother-in-law, standing at the door of the house, holds a small bowl of sugared water into which Emira dips the fingers of her right hand and touches both sides of the doorframe. Then stepping into the house, right foot first, she is introduced to the kitchen, after which her new sisters-in-law celebrate her arrival by dancing, while she stands without moving, apparently oblivious. Later, at the reception, her family is present but they sit at tables apart and do not communicate with her. The sole Islamic touches that I noted were an imam reading brief excerpts from the Koran, and the lack of liquor.--Katrina Thomas","All of the 550 guests, including many children, dance all evening long.

Due to devastation and loss during the Vietnam War, an estimated 145,000 came to the U.S.  The first wedding I photograph is Hmong Christian in Minneapolis in1986.  Later weddings, photographed in Fresno, CA, retain their animist traditions, heeding the spirits and demons of nature, and honoring ancestors. The couple meet when playing a courtship game of pom pov during a festival held in late December and if a boy and girl like each other, he kidnaps her and sends a message to her family that he wants to marry.  In preparing for every wedding four ""messengers,"" two from each family, negotiate her bride price, which is preceded by a ""tie hand"" rite, designed to facilitate a favorable outcome.  The wedding itself is feasting and ritual drinking by men, according to many rules, while the bridegroom and best man genuflect constantly to honor living and dead members of both families.  As the Hmong have become integrated into mainstream society, many of their marriage customs have disappeared.--Katrina Thomas","The bridal party poses for a picture.  Mee has been married by a Hmong Christian priest and stands between her attendant, a member of the bridegroom's family, and her husband Toua.  Mee now belongs to his clan.  She is aged 18 and Toua is 16, the usual age for a man to marry.

The marriage illustrated was not arranged. The bride and bridegroom, schooled in both Pakistan and the West, fell in love. They are the children of international parents, each with a Pakistani father and a mother of mixed heritage.

A Buddhist temple, known as a wat, serves as their civic center and couples may seek a blessing for marriage from resident monks. The couple makes no vows. On the morning of the wedding, they invite monks from a nearby temple to bless them.

At the close of the celebration, an extensive farewell, lasting more than an hour, is the cepoviny, played out in music and song, releasing the bride to her husband, only after many warnings to her and jokes about married life.--Katrina Thomas","Tomasz alternates dancing and singing --  he is showing off, Halina doing little steps apart -- until finally they embrace again","Thomas, Katrina",49.15.tif,Bryn Mawr College,Bryn Mawr College Special Collections,Katrina Thomas Ethnic Wedding Photographs,"This image is part of a larger digital database of ethnic wedding photographs taken by Katrina Thomas (Bryn Mawr Class of 1949), documenting more than 70 ethnic and religious groups in the United States.

"Swedish Wedding, Staten  Island, New York, 1973",Swedish,"Staten Island, NY",1973,Dancing | Feast,Feast and reception | Dancing | Newlyweds | Inter-ethnic marriage,"Most Swedish-Americans are Lutherans or Methodists, emigrating between 1840 and 1910, passing through New York City, to settle the upper Midwest.  However, I photograph two Swedish weddings in NYC, one, being a Swedish bride who marries a Norwegian. She wears a white wedding dress. The other couple chooses to wear traditional dress of a particular region.  Both brides wear the crown of the Vasa Order, originally a fraternal society for Swedes but now open to all of Scandinavian descent.--Katrina Thomas","After the nuptials in a Lutheran church in Brooklyn, for a Swedish bride and Norwegian groom, everyone drives across a bridge to Staten Island to eat, drink, and dance at the Nansen Lodge Social Club, a fraternal organization affiliated with the Sons of Norway.","Thomas, Katrina",55.13.tif,Bryn Mawr College,Bryn Mawr College Special Collections,Katrina Thomas Ethnic Wedding Photographs,"This image is part of a larger digital database of ethnic wedding photographs taken by Katrina Thomas (Bryn Mawr Class of 1949), documenting more than 70 ethnic and religious groups in the United States.
