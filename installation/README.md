# Installing OpenRefine

OpenRefine is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Please note that laptops/devices running mobile operating systems and web app platforms (Chrome OS, Android, iOS) are NOT supported by OpenRefine. OpenRefine requires a working Java runtime environment, otherwise the program will not start.

The latest stable release of OpenRefine is version 3.1. You may download it [here](http://openrefine.org/download.html).

| Platform | Installation Instructions |
---------|---------------------------|
| Windows  | Download the ZIP package, unzip, and double-click `openrefine.exe` to start. |
| Mac OS X | Download the DMG package, open, drag the application icon into the Applications folder, and double click it to start. |
| Linux | Download the TAR package, extract it, and run `./refine` to start. |

#### OpenRefine Install Test

Upon launch, OpenRefine will run as a local server, opening your computer's browser. As long as OpenRefine is running, you can point your browser at http://127.0.0.1:3333/ to use it, even in several browser tabs/windows.
